Explanation of the Code:

Timing Thresholds:

SHORT_MIN, SHORT_MAX: Define the duration range for a short pulse.
LONG_MIN, LONG_MAX: Define the duration range for a long pulse.
LONG_OFF_THRESHOLD: Defines the minimum duration of an OFF period that indicates the start of a new transmission sequence.
File Reading:

The script reads parsed RF signal data from parsed_rf_signal.txt.
It skips the header line and parses each line, storing the signal and duration values in the signal_data list.
It includes error handling to skip invalid lines.
Signal Pair Processing:

The script iterates through pairs of signal data entries.
It checks for long OFF periods to identify the start of new transmission sequences.
It applies Manchester encoding rules to determine the bit value based on the duration of the signal pairs (long-short = 1, short-long = 0).
It skips invalid signal pairs (unexpected durations or signal orders).
Decoded bits are appended to the sequence list, and sequences are added to the decoded_bits list when a long off period is detected, or at the end of the file.
Decoded Sequence Output:

The script prints the decoded bit sequences to the console.
Each sequence is displayed along with its length (number of bits).
The script effectively decodes the RF signal data into binary sequences based on the defined thresholds and encoding rules.
