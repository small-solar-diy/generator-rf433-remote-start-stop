Explanation of the Code:

Imports:

datetime: For date and time operations (not used in the core logic, but can be added for logging).
RPi.GPIO: For interacting with the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins.
sys: For system-specific parameters and functions (not directly used but can be used for things like command line arguments).
time: For time-related functions (e.g., getting current time, pausing).
collections.deque: For efficient appending of data (faster than lists for growing data).
Constants:

RECEIVE_PIN: The GPIO pin number connected to the signal source.
MAX_DURATION: The duration of the recording in seconds.
RECEIVED_SIGNAL: A list of two deque objects to store the timestamps and signal values. deque is used because it allows fast appends.
GPIO Initialization:

GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM): Sets the GPIO numbering mode to BCM (Broadcom SOC channel numbers).
GPIO.setup(RECEIVE_PIN, GPIO.IN): Configures the specified pin as an input.
Recording Loop:

start_time_ns: Records the starting time in nanoseconds.
The while loop continues until the elapsed time exceeds MAX_DURATION.
Inside the loop:
current_time_ns: Gets the current time in nanoseconds.
The elapsed time in microseconds is calculated, converted to an integer, and appended to RECEIVED_SIGNAL[0].
The signal value from the RECEIVE_PIN is read using GPIO.input() and appended to RECEIVED_SIGNAL[1].
Data Processing:

GPIO.cleanup(): Releases the GPIO resources.
The deque objects are converted to regular lists for easier file writing.
File Saving:

The script opens a text file named rf_signal_data.txt in write mode ("w").
It writes a header row ("Time (Âµs), Signal").
It iterates through the timestamps and signal values and writes them to the file, separated by a comma.
Output:

The script prints messages to the console indicating the start and end of recording, the number of samples recorded, and the filename where the data is saved.
The timestamps are in microseconds, and the signal values are 0 or 1, representing the digital signal levels.
