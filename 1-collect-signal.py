"""
1-collect-signal.py

This script records a digital signal received on a specified GPIO pin of a Raspberry Pi.
It captures the timestamps and signal values for a defined duration and saves the data to a text file.

Press the start button continually before and after the collection is running
Keep the remote very close to the receiver (6") and less noise is captured
