Explanation of the Code:

Update the strat and stop code with the ones from your remote fob.

Imports:

time: For precise timing control.
sys: For accessing command-line arguments.
RPi.GPIO: For interacting with the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins.
Code Definitions:

start: The binary code to start the transmission.
stop: The binary code to stop the transmission.
Timing Constants:

TRANSMIT_PIN: The GPIO pin used for transmitting the signal.
NUM_ATTEMPTS: The number of times the code will be transmitted.
short_delay: The duration of a short pulse in microseconds.
long_delay: The duration of a long pulse in microseconds.
extended_delay: The delay between transmission attempts in microseconds.
precise_sleep(delay_us) Function:

Implements a busy-wait sleep for precise microsecond delays.
Uses time.monotonic_ns() to get nanosecond-resolution time.
Calculates the target time and loops until it's reached.
transmit_code(code) Function:

Sets up the GPIO pin for output.
Iterates through the specified number of transmission attempts.
Iterates through each bit in the code.
Applies Manchester encoding:
'0': Short pulse (HIGH) followed by a long pulse (LOW).
'1': Long pulse (HIGH) followed by a short pulse (LOW).
Uses precise_sleep() for accurate timing.
Measures and prints the actual elapsed time for each bit transmission.
Adds an extended delay between transmission attempts.
Cleans up GPIO settings after transmission.
if __name__ == '__main__': Block:

This block is executed when the script is run directly.
Processes command-line arguments.
Calls the transmit_code() function for each argument.
This allows the user to call the script with the start or stop codes, or other codes, as command line arguments.
Example: python transmit.py start
